# Unable to Find Upload in Prearchive

There may be a time when you are unable to find your uploaded session in the **prearchive** or in the project **archive**.

This can occur due to the following reasons:

The project hasn't been created in CNDA yet.

**OR**

CNDA could not locate the project information within the session's metadata.

However, in these cases, the session is probably stored in the CNDA Unassigned prearchive.

For assistance in locating your session, contact the **CNDA Help Desk** at cnda-help@wustl.edu
