# Adding an Alias to a Project

## Description
**NOTE:** To add an alias to a project you **MUST** have **OWNER** access to that project.

In the CNDA, adding an alias to a project is useful in several respects:

It is used by the system to route a session to the correct project.
It can help a user when searching for a project.
It can account for the occasional typo in a session's project label.
It can denote the project's affiliation to a larger group (ex. CCIR, NP).


## Instructions
Open the **Project**.
Click Edit **Details**.


The **Edit Project Details form** will open.
Click in a **text box to the right of Alias(es)**. If all are full, erase the text from one box -- this will not remove that alias from the project.
Enter the alias you wish to use.
Click **Save Changes**.
