# Data Sharing

## Description

All data in CNDA is "owned" by a primary project - the project that it was first created in, or first uploaded to. However, it is possible for any project user to share data from this primary project into another project.

When you share data from a primary project to another project, **this does not create a copy of that data element.** Instead, both projects now access the same data element.

**Shared data can only be edited or modified in its primary project.** Thus, if shared data is modified or deleted in its primary project, the data is also modified or deleted in any project that it has been shared into.
