# Requesting Clinical Imaging Data From BJC

## Description
CNDA provides a service which delivers de-identified clinical imaging to a project. A PI or study coordinator will typically approach us saying they were told we could download images from the PACS for them.

If the the study IRB has not previously requested a data pull, IRB documentation must be provided, and we must get approval for the pull from BJC. Please follow the steps below to request the data pull.

The fee for this service is $6 per imaging session. You will be invoiced after your sessions have been pulled.

## Instructions
1. Send the CNDA Help Desk IRB information from the study. The help desk will need a copy of the **IRB Detail and Approval memo** before data can be pulled.

   - Hit key command to print (Ctrl+P, etc).
   - Choose Nitro, Adobe or any .other PDF-creator software.
   - Before saving the file make sure that Section 5.3 does not cut off the table that lists the members on the IRB.  We need the information listed in the third to last column in that table and sometimes it gets cut off upon saving.
