# How do I Perform A Prearchive Cleanup?

## Where Is the Prearchive Located in CNDA and How Do I Enter It?

There are two distinct ways to review the CNDA prearchive:

1. **View All Sessions Across All Projects**  
   - Select **Upload** in the top ribbon and then click **"Go to Prearchive."**
   - This will display prearchive sessions associated with the various projects you have access to.

2. **View the Prearchive for One Project**  
   - Go to the homepage of your project in CNDA.  
   - Locate the **Actions** box on the right side of the page.  
   - Click the **View Prearchive** button. This will take you to the prearchive section of your project, displaying all prearchive sessions for that project.

## What Tasks Can I Perform While in the Prearchive Section of My Project?

In the prearchive section, you can select a session by checking the box to the left of its name. You’ll then have several options:

- **Details**:  
  Opens a new tab with all the details of the selected session, allowing you to review it before archiving.

- **Archive**:  
  Clicking the **Archive** button initiates the archiving process.  
  This process takes about 5 minutes, and you will receive an email once it is complete.

- **Review and Archive**:  
  Clicking the **Review and Archive** button takes you to the Review and Archive page.  
  This page will show you the details of what is inside your session.  
  On this page, you can rename the session as well as the subject.  
  This renaming helps to resolve merge conflicts by saving a session separately with a unique name.  
  At the bottom of the page is a Submit button, which allows you to archive the session.  
  
  **Note:** If a prearchive session and an archived session have the same name, and you are sure they need to be merged together, they can be merged on this page. This merging will work if all scan series numbers are unique. If there is a conflict due to duplicate scan series numbers, this page can help solve that issue as well. After you press Submit, the system will check for duplicate scan series numbers. If they have been found and a merge is possible, you can press the Continue button to proceed, and the system will automatically rename the duplicate scan series numbers to get rid of any conflict, and complete the merge for you.  

  If a Continue button never appears after pressing Submit, there may be other error messages that are preventing the merge from being performed.  

- **Delete**:  
  Use the **Delete** button (on the far right) to delete a session if it is not needed.

## How Should I Approach the Prearchive Cleanup?

- Enter the prearchive section and review the sessions in your project.  
- Inspect the details of each session:  
  - **If a session is needed**, archive it by using the **Archive** button.
  - **If a merge is needed**, perform a merge by using the **Review and Archive** button.  
  - **If a session is not needed**, delete it using the **Delete** button.

## Where Are My Project’s Archiving Settings Located?

Each project has a **Manage** tab on the homepage. On this tab, you’ll find a button labeled **Define Prearchive Settings**.  

This page allows you to configure archiving settings for your project:  
- Place everything into the prearchive.  
- Place everything in the archive with a few exceptions.  
- Place everything in the archive and overwrite some of those exceptions.  

For more details, review the options on the **Define Prearchive Settings** page.
