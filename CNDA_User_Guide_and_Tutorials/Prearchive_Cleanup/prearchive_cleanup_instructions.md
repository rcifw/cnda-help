In the prearchive section, you can select a session by checking the box on to the left of its name. You’ll then have several options, but the most important ones are:
Details: Clicking this will open a new tab with all the details of the selected session, allowing you to review it before archiving.
Archive: Often, the primary action you'll want to take after selecting a session by clicking on the checkbox in front of it, is to use the Archive button (marked with an arrow in the image). Clicking this Archive button initiates the archiving process, which may take about 5 minutes to complete. You should receive an email once archiving is done. 
Delete: Sometimes, another action you'll want to take after selecting a session is to use the Delete button on far right to delete it.
