## What Tasks Can I Perform While in the Prearchive Section of My Project?

In the prearchive section, you can select a session by checking the box to the left of its name. You’ll then have several options:

- **Details**:  
  Opens a new tab with all the details of the selected session, allowing you to review it before archiving.

- **Archive**:  
  Clicking the **Archive** button initiates the archiving process.  
  This process takes about 5 minutes, and you will receive an email once it is complete.

- **Review and Archive**:  
  Clicking the **Review and Archive** button takes you to the Review and Archive page.  
  This page will show you the details of what is inside your session.  
  On this page, you can rename the session as well as the subject.  
  This renaming helps to resolve merge conflicts.  
  At the bottom of the page is a Submit button, which allows you to archive the session.

- **Delete**:  
  Use the **Delete** button (on the far right) to delete a session if it is not needed.

## Where Are My Project’s Archiving Settings Located?

Each project has a **Manage** tab on the homepage. On this tab, you’ll find a button labeled **Define Prearchive Settings**.  

This page allows you to configure archiving settings for your project:  
- Place everything into the prearchive.  
- Place everything in the archive with a few exceptions.  
- Place everything in the archive and overwrite some of those exceptions.  

For more details, review the options on the **Define Prearchive Settings** page.
