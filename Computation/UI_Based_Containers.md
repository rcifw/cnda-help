## Container Jobs from CNDA Web UI

The CNDA offers a limited set of Docker Containers that can be launched
from the CNDA web UI.
A *Container Service* on CNDA
 * Makes your project files available to the selected container
 * Launches the container
 * Optionally writes data back to your project if the container provides that data

More details on the CNDA containers is found in [Docker Containers on CNDA](../CNDA_User_Guide_and_Tutorials/Docker_Containers_on_CNDA/Docker_Containers_on_CNDA.md).

The current list of containers available through the web UI is found in [Container Images and Commands](../Containers/Images_and_Commands.md)
