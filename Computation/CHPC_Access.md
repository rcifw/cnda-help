# Direct SSH Access to Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC)

The Research Computing and Informatics Facility (RCIF) supports a [High Performance Computing](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/research/core-resources/research-computing-and-informatics-facility/services-equipment/) environment.
The RCIF will mount your CNDA project data in read-only mode to CHPC servers.
You can run your HPC jobs directly from those data mounts or copy the files
to another location on the CHPC storage system.

Notes:
1. Files are mounted read only to protect the integrity of the data on the CNDA. Mechanisms exist to programatically write results back to your CNDA project.
2. Send an email to support@rcif.wustl.edu to request this service. There is no fee involved.
3. The CHPC has both free and subscription services.
Find out more about the charges at the [CHPC Accounting FAQs](https://docs.chpc.wustl.edu/rates/), or you can contact support@rcif.wustl.edu with specific questions.
