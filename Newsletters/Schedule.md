# CNDA Newsletters

These will be informal notifications about changes and/or updates to CNDA software, operations or other items that will be of interest to some.

Newsletters will be posted as needed.
We do not intend to use this forum to discuss short term outages or small changes that are better announced directly on the CNDA home page.
