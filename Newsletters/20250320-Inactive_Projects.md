# 2025.03.20 Inactive Projects

We have identified slightly more than 1000 Inactive Projects.
These are projects with no activity in the past five years.

We are in the process of making these READONLY in the existing CNDA.
Anyone with access (owner, member, collaborator) is moved to collaborator status.
You can still see the project and associated data, but you cannot modify it.

When this step is complete in the CNDA, we will bring up a separate instance of the system where you will have this same READONLY access to these projects.
At the same time, we will disable these projects in the CNDA.

- CNDA Gold will exist as the system with the READONLY copy of Inactive Projects.
- CNDA itself will continue with Active Projects. Inactive Projects will be visible on the CNDA.

The date/time for this update is TBD.
We believe it will occur the week of 2025.03.24.
