# Getting Started in CNDA

As of July 1, 2012, the CNDA is the CCIR’s permanent archive for all deidentified DICOM data.
Clinical imaging data will continue to be stored on the BJC PACS.
So if your research study scans at the CCIR, then your data will ultimately land in the CNDA.

## Your CNDA Project

In the CNDA, data is organized into [Projects, Subjects, and Experiments](../CNDA_User_Guide_and_Tutorials/Projects/How_Project_Data_is_Organized_in_the_CNDA.md).
Once your new project is approved in the CCIR, the CCIR staff will create a corresponding CNDA project using your CCIR number as the project id.

For example: if your CCIR number is 1234, then your project in CNDA will be CCIR_01234.

If you check the CNDA option on the CCIR Registration Form, then the CCIR will give you (and your team) access to the new project when it is created.

**If you already have an existing CNDA project** into which you wish to direct your new CCIR project's data, please contact the CNDA Help Desk (cnda-help@wustl.edu) as soon as you have your new CCIR number. The help desk will alias your existing CNDA project, so that the new CCIR project's data will automatically land there.

## Your Data

By default, your new project will be set to “autoarchive merge” (option 3 in Archive & Prearchive Settings). This means that your data will be sent to and made available automatically in your project archive (as opposed to being held in the prearchive).

Any project [Owner](../CNDA_User_Guide_and_Tutorials/Access/Roles_and_Permissions.md) may change this setting. Typically imaging sessions are sent by the scanner operator to the CNDA on the same day as acquisition. If you cannot find your data within 24 hours of acquisition, please contact the CNDA Help Desk (cnda-help@wustl.edu).

## Get Access

If you did not choose the CNDA option on your CCIR protocol enrollment form, then you should contact the CNDA Help Desk (cnda-help@wustl.edu) for further assistance in accessing your data.
