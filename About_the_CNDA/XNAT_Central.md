# XNAT Central

XNAT Central is an XNAT that was operated by the 
[Neuroinformatics Research Group](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/research/research-centers/computational-imaging-research-center-circ/labs/marcus-lab) (NRG)
as a public service.
NRG collaborators usedd this sytem to upload imaages, demographic data and clinical data. Both public and private datasets were available on XNAT Central.

The NRG is in the process of removing this system from production.
We anticipate that all XNAT Central projects will be either retired or migrated to other services by the end of 2023.
