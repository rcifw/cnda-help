# CNDA-Help
This repository contains the source files for the CNDA Help documentation. The documentation is written in markdown and is built using [vuepress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/).

## Local Development
To run the documentation locally, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed as well as [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

Once you have these installed, you can run the following commands to start the documentation server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:8080/` where you can view the documentation. Changes made to the markdown files will be reflected in real time.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the documentation, please fork the repository and make a pull request with your changes. Once the pull request is approved, the changes will be merged into the main branch and the documentation will be updated.
